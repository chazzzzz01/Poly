Poly is a mini version of python, some of it concepts is form python like the variable, function, and if-else . 

RECOMMENDED TO LEARN THE BASIC OF PYTHON 
LEARN THE FUNCTION, IF-ELSE, RECURSION AND Closures


BASIC CONCEPT OF POLY 

recome

VARIABLE 
so in poly we have here the let, let is like the name box that hold the string, numbers. 

let [variable] = [value]
print({variable})

EXAMPLE: 

1. Basic Structure

Poly uses simple rules â€” like keywords let, func, and print.

let name = "Lisa"
print(name)

OUTPUT 
Lisa

2. Expressions & Math

You can do normal math operations:

let a = 10
let b = 5
print(a + b/)
print(a - b/)
print(a * b/)
print(a / b/)

Output:

15
5
50
2.0

just add some / to have spacing

let num = 4
print(num + 6)

Output:

10



3. Functions

Functions are reusable pieces of code.

func add(x, y) = x + y
print(add(3, 7))

func mult(x, y) = x * y
print(mult(3, 7))

func sub(x, y) = x - y
print(sub(3, 7))

func div(x, y) = x / y
print(div(3, 7))

Output:
10 21 -4 0.42857142857142855


4. Recursion

Recursion means a function calls itself.

Example:

func factorial(n) = if n <= 1 then 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)
print(factorial(5))


 Output:

120

Explanation:

factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)

factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3)

until it reaches 1.

5. Closures

Closures let functions remember the variables from where they were created.

Example:

func makeMultiplier(x) = func(y) = x * y
let double = makeMultiplier(2)
let triple = makeMultiplier(3)
print(double(5)/)
print(triple(5))


Output:

10 15

Explanation:

makeMultiplier(2) creates a function that always multiplies by 2

makeMultiplier(3) creates a function that always multiplies by 3

So double(5) = 10, triple(5) = 15



6. If-Else (Conditions)

You can write inline or block if statements.

Inline:
let x = 10
print(if x > 5 then "Big" else "Small")


Output:

Big



Block:

let x = "she"

if x == "she" then
    print("Perfect")
else:
    print("Not good")


Output:

Perfect



7. Printing Output

Normal:

print("Hello Poly")


With space after:

print("Hello"/)
print("World")


Output:

Hello World
